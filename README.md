# weather dashboard

### This is a  application for module challenge 6. I worked on this application with the help of my tutor, my team and was doing practicing. I was going through the class recording, [Mozilla]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "dev.Mozilla"), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/ "w3Schools"), asked questions in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com "stackoverflow.com"). . I took lot of help from everyone while conpleting this challenge. This was most challenging assignment I got so far. First I was using the basic API key which was stopped working after a while. Then I used one call API. One call API key working now. As it takes few hours to activate.On weekends I worked for few long hours to finish this assignments. It was full of fun but changed my code from jQuery to JavaScript as my code was having trouble responding. Language I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript in this module. This is my learning stage and I am happy that I am struggling in this challenge because it will sharpen my knowledge and push me to do more.
